### Platforms and tools
#### As the data is small dataset, spreadsheet has been used to
- Exract-Load-Clean-Merge-Transform
- There were too many attributes available, state, cities, areas etc. Only mean, median, number of sales of houses, units and apartments have been selected
- The data was available in qurterly format, therefore, the September value of each year has been picked by "advanced filtering".
