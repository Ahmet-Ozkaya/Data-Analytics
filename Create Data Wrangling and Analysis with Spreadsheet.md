### Platforms and tools
#### As the data is a small dataset, the spreadsheet has been used to
- Extract-Load-Clean-Merge-Transform
- There were too many attributes available, state, cities, areas etc. Only mean, median, and number of sales of houses, units, and apartments have been selected
- The data was available in quarterly format; therefore, the September value of each year has been picked by "advanced filtering".
