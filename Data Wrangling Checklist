# R Checklist Notebook
## ASK
Guiding questions What topic are you exploring?
What is the problem you are trying to solve?
What metrics will you use to measure your data to achieve your objective?
Who are the stakeholders?
Who is your audience for this analysis and how does this affect your analysis process and presentation?
How will this data help your stakeholders make decisions?

Key tasks It's important to understand the problem and any questions about your case study early on so that you're focused on your stakeholders' needs.

    Choose a case study
    Identify the problem
    Determine key stakeholders
    Explore the data and establish metrics

## PREPARE

Guiding questions

    Where is your data located?
    How is the data organized?
    Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?
    How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?
    How did you verify the data’s integrity?
    How does it help you answer your question?
    Are there any problems with the data?

Key tasks

The prepare phase ensures that you have all of the data you need for your analysis and that you have credible, useful data.

    Collect data and store it appropriately
    Identify how it’s organized
    Sort and filter the data
    Determine the credibility of the data

## PROCESS

Guiding questions

    What tools are you choosing and why?
    Have you ensured your data’s integrity?
    What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?
    How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?
    Have you documented your cleaning process so you can review and share those results?

Key tasks

Now that you know your data is credible and relevant to your problem, you'll need to clean it so that your analysis will be error-free.

    Check the data for errors
    Transform the data into the right type
    Document the cleaning process
    Choose your tools

## ANALYZE

Guiding questions

    How should you organize your data to perform analysis on it?
    Has your data been properly formatted?
    What surprises did you discover in the data?
    What trends or relationships have you found in the data?
    How do these insights answer your question or solve the problem?

Key tasks

Now you'll really put your data to work to uncover new insights and discover potential solutions to your problem!

    Aggregate your data so it’s useful and accessible
    Organize and format your data
    Perform calculations
    Identify trends and relationships

## SHARE

Guiding questions

    What story does your data tell?
    How do your findings relate to your original question?
    Who is your audience? What is the best way to communicate with them?
    Can data visualization help you share your findings?
    Is your presentation accessible to your audience?

Key tasks

During the share phase, you'll tell a story using data and communicate your findings.

    Determine the best way to share your findings
    Create effective data visualizations
    Present your findings
    Ensure your work is accessible to your audience

## ACT

Guiding questions

    What is your final conclusion based on your analysis?
    How can you apply your insights?
    Are there any next steps you or your stakeholders can take based on your findings?
    Is there additional data you could use to expand on your findings?
    How can you feature your case study in your portfolio?

Key tasks

After this, your case study will be complete.
But you can use these steps again to help guide you through your analysis process.

    Share next steps with your stakeholders
    Determine if more data could give you new insights
    Upload to your portfolio

### DATA SOURCES


# 1st Level Header

```{r, echo = FALSE}
if(!require('readxl')) {
    install.packages('readxl')
    library('readxl')
}
energy_df <- read_excel("Energy-data.xlsx", skip = 4)

## DATA ANALYZE

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.
When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
>>>>>>> 54d7907004e8f270e24d1f9f40440e8a09d81efe
```



<<<<<<< HEAD
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```
